## Project Description
TradeZone is an online shopping web application that makes online shopping convinient for all users. On load, the user is met with the list of categories available as well as the list of products available in the store.

A user has the option to buy an item immediately . When a user clicks on the 'Buy Item' button a prompt appears asking the user to confirm the purchase. When the user confirms the purchase of the item then a message appears confirming the purchase of an item.

Moreover, there is a 'Delete item' button that when clicked deletes an item fom the database.

In addition, at the bottom of the web page is a form: an add product form. 

The add product form allows a user to add a product to the database and after the website is refreshed (upon clicking the 'Submit' button) the product is displayed as the last product.

The edit product form enables a user to edit the details of a product that is present in the website. The user chooses from a list of options and the details of that product are displayed enabling a user to make changes and update the product's details by clicking on the 'Save changes' button.
